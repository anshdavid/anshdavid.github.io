Hi, I’m Ansh — professional code wrangler, part-time AI whisperer, and full-time enthusiast for all things weird, clever, and slightly chaotic.

I spend my days building AI-powered contraptions that make computers do cool things (and sometimes break in spectacular ways). Whether it’s graph-based test generation, vector search platforms, or teaching machines to read 200-page PDFs so I don’t have to - I’m all in.

When I’m not convincing machines to be smarter, you’ll probably find me:

- 🐶 Talking to dogs like they’re my coworkers (they listen better than most humans).
- 🎬 Binge-watching horror, thriller, and detective series — then pretending I could solve crimes faster than the characters.
- 📚 Reading about random stuff: algorithms, simulation theory, or the fall of the Roman Empire (you never know when that might be relevant).
- 🏠 Staying indoors because… people are loud, and Wi-Fi lives here.

I like to think of myself as a curious engineer trapped in a comedy show, always learning, always tinkering, and occasionally shipping code that actually works on the first try (a rare and magical event).

This blog is my digital playground — where I share experiments, ideas, and the occasional tech rant that probably started as “let me fix this real quick…” and ended three hours later with an entirely new tool.

If you like geeking out about AI, laughing at the absurdity of engineering life, or just need proof that someone else is debugging at 2 AM with snacks nearby, welcome — you’re in the right place.
