<br />
Each passing week, I take my pen in hand,\
To capture thoughts that in my mind do grow.\
On topics vast as sea or grains of sand,\
I weave my words, their essence to bestow.


What truths I've found, what wonders I have seen,\
Are shaped and crafted, bound in written lore.\
Through fleeting hours, where thought and heart convene,\
I pen my musings, seeking ever more.


Oh, reader, here assembled is the hoard,\
A trove of lines to stir both heart and head.\
These humble works, to thee I now afford,\
My labors laid where curious souls are led.

So take these words, and journey where they lead,\
A garden grown from every planted seed.\
<br />
